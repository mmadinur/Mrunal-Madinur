  <h1 class="hero-title">ICONIQ Reflection</h1>

  <div class="blog-content">

    <p>I want to take a moment to reflect on what I genuinely believe will be one of the most defining experiences of my life: my internship at ICONIQ Growth.</p>

    <p>It might sound dramatic, however, the level of exposure I had was unlike anything I had ever experienced before. The volume of information, the sheer credibility of my coworkers, and the caliber of conversations recalibrated my understanding of what “high level” actually means. Yes, my skill set improved in very tangible ways. But the real shift was not technical. It was mental.</p>

    <p>There were moments when I would sit in a room and almost laugh at how unreal it felt. Across the table from partners behind Anthropic’s Series F. On calls with billionaires. In conversations with former leaders of companies like Adyen, Datadog, and Coupa. All while working alongside some of the most driven individuals I have ever met.</p>

    <p> For my Suits lovers, below is the absolute greatest way I can depict my time at ICONIQ.

    <h2 class="takeaways-title">Takeaways</h2>

    <div class="takeaway">
      <h3>Ethos cannot be overstated</h3>
      <p>Coming from San Diego State University, I used to hear that school does not matter, only hard work does. It sounds noble. It is also incomplete. Background and credibility matter more than people admit. Before you speak, people assess where you come from. Hard work is the baseline. Credibility determines the rooms you enter.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="takeaway">
      <h3>Reputation is priceless</h3>
      <p>Credibility gets you in the room. Results determine whether you stay. At ICONIQ, nearly everyone came from a top school or elite bank. That background was not a safety net, it was an expectation. The standard had to be proven daily.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="takeaway">
      <h3>Ego is fuel</h3>
      <p>In a world this competitive, there is no room for insecurity. Conviction is table stakes. The gap is rarely intelligence, it is belief. The world rewards people with a thesis, those who can form clear opinions and defend them without flinching.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="takeaway">
      <h3>Never be so stubborn you cannot change your mind</h3>
      <p>Confidence is powerful, but blind confidence is dangerous. The ability to contribute meaningfully while remaining open to new information is rare. Everyone has something to teach. The moment you think you have nothing left to learn is the moment you plateau.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="takeaway">
      <h3>Take every call</h3>
      <p>Knowledge is everywhere if you are paying attention. The fastest way to learn is to speak directly to people operating at a high level. Professionals compress decades of experience into a single conversation.</p>

    <div class="takeaway">
      <h3>Your greatest asset will always be your network</h3>
      <p>Your network shapes opportunities, outcomes, and access. Staying in touch is what separates you. A small, thoughtful gesture can close a deal. Relationships compound.</p>
