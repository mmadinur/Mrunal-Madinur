    <div class="blog-content">

      <p>I want to take a moment to reflect on what I genuinely believe will be one of the most defining experiences of my life: my internship at ICONIQ Growth.</p>

      <p>It might sound dramatic, however, the level of exposure I had was unlike anything I had ever experienced before. The volume of information, the sheer credibility of my coworkers, and the caliber of conversations recalibrated my understanding of what “high level” actually means. Yes, my skill set improved in very tangible ways (Excel mouse trap). But the real shift was not technical. It was mental.</p>

      <p>There were moments when I would sit in a room and almost laugh at how unreal it felt — across the table from partners behind Anthropic’s Series F, on calls with billionaires, and in conversations with former leaders of companies like Adyen, Datadog, and Coupa. All while working alongside some of the most driven individuals I have ever met.</p>

      <p>For my Suits lovers, below is the absolute greatest way I can depict my time at ICONIQ.</p>

      <h2 class="subheader">Takeaways</h2>

      <div class="takeaway">
        <h3>1. Ethos cannot be overstated</h3>
        <p>Coming from a state school, I used to hear the same recycled line: school does not matter. This is entirely incorrect. Background and credibility shape first impressions, and those impressions determine which rooms you enter.</p>
        <p>Hard work is the baseline. Credibility separates talk from proof.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="takeaway">
        <h3>2. Reputation is priceless</h3>
        <p>Credibility gets you in the room. Results determine whether you stay. Pedigree has a short shelf life without execution.</p>
        <p>At ICONIQ, nearly everyone came from a top school or elite bank. That background was not a safety net — it was an expectation.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="takeaway">
        <h3>3. Ego is fuel</h3>
        <p>In a world this competitive, there is no room for insecurity. Conviction is table stakes. The gap is rarely intelligence — it is belief.</p>
        <p>The world rewards people with a thesis. Those who form clear opinions and defend them without flinching.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="takeaway">
        <h3>4. Never be so stubborn you cannot change your mind</h3>
        <p>Confidence is powerful, but blind confidence is dangerous. The ability to contribute meaningfully while staying open to new information is rare.</p>
        <p>Everyone has something to teach. The moment you think you have nothing left to learn is the moment you stop growing.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="takeaway">
        <h3>5. Take every call</h3>
        <p>Knowledge is everywhere if you are paying attention. The fastest way to learn is to speak directly to people operating at a high level.</p>
        <p>Professionals compress decades of experience into a single conversation.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="takeaway">
        <h3>6. The greatest asset will always be your network</h3>
        <p>Your network shapes opportunities, outcomes, and access. Staying in touch is what separates you.</p>
        <p>A small, thoughtful gesture can close a deal. Relationships compound.</p>
