    <!-- PASTE YOUR FULL POST BELOW -->
    <p>

<p>I want to take a moment to reflect on what I genuinely believe will be one of the most defining experiences of my life: my internship at ICONIQ Growth. <p>

<p>It might sound dramatic, however, the level of exposure I had was unlike anything I had ever experienced before. The volume of information, the sheer credibility of my coworkers, the caliber of conversations, it recalibrated my understanding of what “high level” actually means. Yes, my skill set improved in very tangible ways (Excel mouse trap). But the real shift was not technical. It was mental. <p>

<p>There were moments when I would sit in a room and almost laugh at how unreal it felt. Across the table from partners behind Anthropic’s Series F. On calls with billionaires. In conversations with former leaders of companies like Adyen, Datadog, and Coupa. All while working alongside some of the most driven individuals I have ever met. The exposure was simply on another level. <p> 

<p>For my Suits lovers, below is the absolute greatest way I can depict my time at ICONIQ.<p>
